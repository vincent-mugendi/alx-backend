- Pagination is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable parts. In the context of [Your Project Name], pagination allows users to navigate through a list of items, such as search results or data tables, by displaying a limited number of items per page.

## How Pagination Works

When a user performs a query that returns a large number of items, [Your Project Name] uses pagination to display a subset of those items on each page. The user can then navigate to different pages to view additional items.

## Features

- **Page Navigation**: Users can navigate between pages using the pagination controls.
- **Page Size**: Users can configure the number of items displayed per page.
- **Total Items Count**: [Your Project Name] displays the total number of items and pages available.
